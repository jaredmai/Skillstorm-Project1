<h1>Skillstorm - Sailpoint Developer / Project 1</h1>

Project 1 - Employee Management System is a full-stack web application that allows users to create employee and office entities through an intuitive UI. The front-end is powered by Angular, the back-end is powered by Spring Boot, and the backend is a MySQL Database. All CRUD operations are useable on the front-end, and all edge-cases are effectively handled by the back-end before reaching the database. Any error message is cleanly displayed to the user so they can understand the problem.
